Upcoming Tasks:
- function to create faux bubbles
- associate faux-bubbles that links to real bubble
- show list of people who are connected via faux bubbles
- "pull up" bubble when clicking on faux bubble
- order bubble into grid
	- to be used in search
- method to call all in array (group call)

- if speaking to a person already and want to add additional person, drag and drop

Faux-bubbles:
- do not actually retrieve or do any sort of network listening

Easyrtc Methods To Try:
- doesDataChannelWork(otherUser) → {Boolean}
- getConnectionCount() → {Number}
- getConnectStatus(otherUser) → {String}
- setDisconnectListener(disconnectListener)
- setGotConnection(gotConnectionCB)
- updatePresence(state, statusText)
- usernameToIds(username, room)
- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/easyrtc/OasRGLKWGSY ***** this!!!

Performance Improvements:
- Make sure to use prototypes!
- Make more object oriented
